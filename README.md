## What is a project

Everyone have a personal projects directory. It can be your `Documents`,
it can be your home directory. Sometimes you have multiple directories,
like work, personal, college, etc.

Finding a project is easy when you have a few projects and a central
directory, but when any of projects or directories grows a lot, it gets
really difficult to find stuff you just wanted to work on.

Here comes `prj`, a quick project jump tool based on a global path
variable: Project directories are present in `$project_path`.

This path variable can be enhanced the way you like with globbing tricks
or even more complex setups that can be made on your init file.

## So... How to?

```fish
$ omf install prj
```

Use `$OMF_CONFIG/before.init.fish` to setup your `$projects_path`:

> `$OMF_CONFIG/before.init.fish`
```fish
set -g $projects_path ~/workspace
```

You can invoke `prj` to quickly jump to a best effort match:

```fish
/home/derek> prj hello
/home/derek/workspace/helloworld>
```

Completions are included, so you can always do a fish pager search.

When multiple matches are found, `fzg` is invoked to choose the project.
